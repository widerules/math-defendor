# The Idea #

The Math-Defendor is currently in prototype stage. The game was a part of Mobile Systems course at University of Amsterdam, held in academic year 11/12.

It was not necessary to actually develop the game, rather report whole designing process, it was more fun to code it. However, we achieved only the prototype stage, with basics of UI and gameplay. There are some known bugs, but we didn't care much of them since our goal was to present 10 minutes demo. And after this many commits, it's easy to avoid the bugs you know ;)


# What is Math-Defendor? #

It's a learning game intended for smartphones for relatively short-time user sessions.

The game incorporates classical "waves of enemies coming" concept while the learning aspect is formulated in solving mathematical expressions. Therefore the game improve arithmetical skills of it's user.

We wanted to avoid creating our app in typical for e-learning software manner. We did not want it to be a “learning tool” that serves it’s purpose in shabby way and only to people deeply motivated to gain particular knowledge or improve particular abilities. Rather we wanted create an app that will be used to relax and to provide additional entertainment while the gameplay will be designed in a manner that it’s side effect will be a developing some particular skills.
